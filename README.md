**WIP** ðŸš§

Brief explanation: This is an app for creating interactive wikis for projects or any other things. This project is in the very early stages of development, so there are not many features yet. The `projects` tab on GitHub lists all the planned features. Some of the planned features:

- Roadmap planning
- Ability to selfhost so you can integrate easily with existing sites
- Collaboration
- Store to GitHub repository or the database
- [Others planned features](https://github.com/users/LukaHietala/projects/9?query=is%3Aopen+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

Contributing guidelines [here](https://github.com/LukaHietala/create-wiki/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) (a good way to help the project is by fixing small things marked as `TODO` or `FIXME`)

App is under the [MIT license](https://github.com/LukaHietala/create-wiki/blob/main/LICENSE)
